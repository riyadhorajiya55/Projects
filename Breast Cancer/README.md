# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is **Benign** or **Malignant** based on medical diagnostic features.

The implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
